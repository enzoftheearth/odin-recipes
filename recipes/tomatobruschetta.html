        <h1>Tomato Bruschetta</h1>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                This classic recipe is for lazy summer days that beg for moving slowly and snacking often. Chop tomatoes, place them in a colander, shower them with salt, then make yourself a drink or go for a swim. The longer they drain, the better they’ll be. This bruschetta gets better as it sits for a bit, so make it up to an hour ahead. While most bruschetta recipes have you rub a raw garlic clove on toasted bread, this one calls for making a quick infused oil that’s stirred into the tomatoes and basil, providing a more delicate garlicky note. Pile it all on toasted bread, and enjoy bite after juicy bite.
                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1 lb plum tomatoes</li>
                            <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
                            <li>5 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                            <li>2 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
                            <li>8 large basil leaves</li>
                            <li>Grilled or toasted crusty bread, for serving</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>Steps</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Core and chop the tomatoes, then transfer to a colander over a bowl or in the sink. Add the salt and gently stir. Let drain for up to 2 hours.</li>
                            <li>Meanwhile, make the garlic oil: In a small saucepan, warm the olive oil and garlic over low heat until the garlic is softened and fragrant, about 5 minutes, making sure the garlic doesn’t brown. Set aside to cool.</li>
                            <li>Roll the basil leaves up and thinly slice crosswise.</li>
                            <li>When the oil is cool and the tomatoes are well drained, combine the tomatoes, garlic oil and basil in a medium bowl. Season with additional salt, to taste. Spoon over toasted bread.</li>
                        </ol>
