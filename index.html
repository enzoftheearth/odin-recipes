                        <ul>
                            <li>10 oz Canned Chicken</li>
                            <li>1 oz grated parmesan</li>
                            <li>1 large Egg</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Steps</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Thoroughly drain the canned chicken, getting as much moisture out as possible.</li>
                            <li>Spread chicken on a baking sheet lined with a
                                silicon mat. Bake at 350 for 10 minutes to dry out the chicken.</li>
                            <li>Once chicken is done baking for 10 minutes remove and place in a mixing bowl. Increase heat of oven to 500 degrees.</li>
                            <li>Add cheese and egg to the bowl with chicken and mix.</li>
                            <li>Pour mixture onto baking sheet lined with a silicon mat and spread thin. Placing parchment paper on top and using a rolling pin makes this easier.</li>
                            <li>Optional: With a spatula, press the edges of the crust in to create a ridge for the crust. This is beneficial is you're using toppings that may slide off (i.e. eggs).</li>
                            <li>Bake the crust for 8-10 minutes at 500 degrees Farenheit.</li>
                            <li>Remove crust from oven. Add desired toppings and bake for another 6-10 minutes at 500 degrees. Toppings will dictate final cooking time.</li>
                            <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool for a few minutes. Your life is now changed. Enjoy!</li>
